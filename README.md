Open Source USB to Floppy Drive Controller for Retrobrewcomputers &amp; hobbyists

Help Wanted: PC and PIC18F software writers to write code for prototype USB to FDC module.  

Note: there is no software for this project right now so if you plan to help with software expect to start at the beginning.  PIC18F experience would be beneficial

My intent is for this to be an ad-hoc team project with members having various specialities like software, firmware, hardware, disk formats, etc.

If you want to join up then you can post in the discussions on this repo or contact me on retrobrewcomputers.org

There is a thread on retrobrewcomputers.org forum discussing the topic of USB to FDC devices

Initial hardware is designed and ready to go to PCB manufacturing.  

Assuming others join the project for writing software I will order some prototype PCBs and distribute.

If you see the hardware design needs changes or things which would make it more usable please post in discussions.

# FAQ

Why using only through-hole components?  Fair question.  I choose through-hole only for the prototype hardware phase.  Assuming development matures and software is written then hardware can be easily updated to SMD.  All the current components are available in SMD versions.  SMD could potentially could reduce PCB size dramatically but until we are sure the hardware is functioning 100% it is much easier to update PCB with through-hole components than SMD

How much do the PCBs cost?  No cost for people willing to write software.  Assuming sufficient interest to proceed with the project I will order PCBs and ship one to you for your build.  The board construction is simple enough most any hobbyist should be able to build it and the parts are commonly available.  If for some reason you cannot build your own please contact me to make arrangements for a pre-built board
