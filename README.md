Open Source USB to Floppy Drive Controller for Retrobrewcomputers &amp; hobbyists

Help Wanted: PC and PIC18F software writers to write code for prototype USB to FDC module.  

Note: there is no software for this project right now so if you plan to help with software expect to start at the beginning.  PIC18F experience would be beneficial

My intent is for this to be an ad-hoc team project with members having various specialities like software, firmware, hardware, disk formats, etc.

If you want to join up then you can post in the discussions on this repo or contact me on retrobrewcomputers.org

There is a thread on retrobrewcomputers.org forum discussing the topic of USB to FDC devices

Initial hardware is designed and ready to go to PCB manufacturing.  

Assuming others join the project for writing software I will order some prototype PCBs and distribute.

If you see the hardware design needs changes or things which would make it more usable please post in discussions.
