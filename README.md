Open Source USB to Floppy Drive Controller for Retrobrewcomputers &amp; hobbyists

Help Wanted: PC and PIC18F software writers to write code for prototype USB to FDC module

My intent is for this to be an ad-hoc team project with members having various specialities like software, firmware, hardware, disk formats, etc.

If you want to join up then you can post in the discussions on this repo or contact me on retrobrewcomputers.org

There is a thread on retrobrewcomputers.org forum discussing the topic of USB to FDC devices
